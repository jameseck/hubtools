# Add the following to ~/.bashrc:
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin" # Add RVM to PATH for scripting
[[ -s "~/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "~/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*

# Then run:

gem install bundle

# From the directory containing the Gemfile from this repo:
bundle install

# This should install all the gems required to run serverspec

# From any image repo, you should be able to run:

docker-compose build
rspec spec/spec_helper.rb
